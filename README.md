# Welcome to the NZ benefit


## Basic overview 
Welcome and good on you for seeking assistance. No matter what you feel, have been told, or experience. it's vital that you've sought and got support for your situation. This is a no frills guide to what myself and others have learned while on the benefit.

There are two main benefits: 

Jobseekers & Supported Living.

Jobseekers can have a three month medical deferral, which can be deferred infinitely, if you have a temporary disability which will last for a decent amount of time, investigate the suppoted living payment with your doctor.

> *Note: that your approved medical costs/stated disability/jobseekers status will expire every three months, you will recieve a letter and mail in MYMSD, if you're unsure call and ask, this can be vital and greatly affect your quality of life.*

## How WINZ Works
WINZ appears to work on the model of "We know exactly what we've given you so manage". This makes sense in some ways, but also means you need to ask/make an appointment for every need that you have. You will *not* have enough to cover more than the bare minimum. 

However there  is barely any means testing, so make sure you engage with winz early *do not wait until you're out of funds if possible.* Forms can take up to five days to process. BUT they can be urgently done over the phone if there is a time restraint.

Bring water, and calming things with you to the office, meditation apps are plentiful. Staff are happy to help with water, but there are usually no watercoolers. 

There is a form for everything, so download an app for filling out forms, just in case an urgent needs arises. 

Don't undersell your needs while you are on the benefit, and find multiple supports. 

Do not rush getting better, getting support. When in doubt slow down, and focus on what's important.

## Getting Help
If you have time, search the WINZ website with google, it has a bunch of information, the website is hostile at best.Most of the time, it's best to call the hotline 0800559009. 

You can skip the automated prompts by repeatedly pressing zero. Try to not to abuse this, but you will have days where you will not want to do their dance. You do NOT have to give them your client number to get information, **this is especially important to withold if you are asking questions about potential changes to your living situation or relationship**. 


* To hide your Caller-ID from all calls dial **\*31**  to re-enable Caller-ID dial **Dial #31**
* To hide your number for a single call dial or add **\*67** or **0197** before the number.

*It's best to contact your provider directly to ensure it's been turned off.*

* You can ask to see and correct personal information WINZ holds about you by asking when you call.

## Financial, debts and other
Make sure you get a payment card early, as you can use the last of your money to pay an unexpected cost, then get food assistance.
* Do make sure you get budgeting and finance support early. 
* If the person that is helping you, makes you feel bad or abuses you, find another service ASAP. 
* If you are in a small area where this isn't a possibility, googling your problem then adding "Reddit" on the end, will find you lots of people's advice.

## Working while on the benefit 
While working on the jobseekers (INCLUDING MEDICAL DEFERALL - Most people with mental health issues are on this) you may only earn $80, any more then you are docked. This INCLUDES contract work where you are paid infrequently. This means that people earning infrequently, being paid infrequently are docked twice. (Once on decleration, once on "payday").
* If you are working and invoicing. Explain to your clients and use automated platforms to bill $80 at a time. 
* Waiting a little bit to declare means that it will be added on as a debt on your account
* If you are supporting a friend on the benefit, gift cards, store credit and online purchases are some of the way you can help make their lives easier. 
* Around two months after PAYE is submitted, the IRD will send information to WINZ, who will then follow up. 


## The supported living payment

If you have been on the benefit for over two years, or are suffering a condition that means that you are unable to work for over two years, then the supported living payment is where you should be. 
  
* There's a $100 cash incentive to manage a bit of work
* The payment rate is higher than the jobseekers
  

## Payment Cards

  
If you are going to be on the benefit for an extended period of time, you will eventually encounter "payment cards".

  

General rules:

  

 * Payment cards and "benefit advances" can ONLY pay a "supplier"

 *   **This Includes Bond** so if you are renting privately, you will have to gather information. This will take up to a week.

 * If you are in a situation where you may need to leave your residence and immediately start another place. Ensure the other party is aware of the delay, and is open to registering as a supplier

  

## Urgent Assistance

* Whether or not you are on a benefit, urgent assistance for food is available. This is available over the phone but in most cases will need a visit to an office.

  

## General tips and tricks

  

* Keep copies of all information you provide to WINZ. They appear to store all information submitted at the same time in a single file, and will often scroll past accidentally. (Doctors can provide a printout of the automatic form)

* There is NO process for a case manager to get notified when a new supplier is registered. This means it's on you to keep following up over the phone. 

  
## Managing Relationships

Money issues can put a big strain on your friendships and relationships

* Where possible spend money only on the basics, don't be afraid of asking people to borrow money for non essentials, people can feel pressured to give you money otherwise
* If possible, avoid stores that are hostile to low income people, don't be afraid to complain to the company at a later point if the business is large
* If a doctor is unhelpful or hostile, you have the legal right to complain to the managing director of that general practice. They are very helpful and understanding. 
* Issues are not often a personal vendetta against you, even though it may feel that way. People are trying to do their best, but it's inevitable some people will not believe or understand you. 
* Try to not take hostility personally, people will react as they do, but they are more likely stereotyping. They may just not understand your reason to act a certain way
* Get as much help as you can
  
  
  
  
## Making Change

WINZ should be there to support kiwis when they fall on hard times. Instead people who aren't coping are stretched even more thin. Here's some stuff you can do.

* Join the https://www.facebook.com/WeAreBeneficiaries/ page
* Talk with friends and family about your struggles. 
* Seek out and help support the many community agencies
